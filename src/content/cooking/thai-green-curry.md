# Thai Green Curry

*Recipe adapted from @hotthaikitchen*

This authentic Thai green curry is aromatic, creamy, and perfectly balanced with sweet, salty, and spicy flavors. The key is to properly bloom the curry paste in coconut cream first to develop the deep, complex flavors that make this dish so special.

## Ingredients

- **Mae ploy green curry paste**: 3.5 tbsp
- **Coconut milk**: 1 can (400 ml/13.5fl oz)
- **Chicken/vegetable stock**: 1 cup
- **Fish sauce / Worcestershire sauce**: 1 tbsp
- **Brown sugar / palm sugar / jaggery**: 1 tbsp
- **Cilantro leaves**: per taste
- **Salt**: to taste
- **Protein of your choice**: 200-250g, cut thin
- **Bell peppers**: 1/2-1 pepper depending on size
- **Beans**: 50g
- **Optional vegetables**: eggplant, broccoli, peas, etc.

## Directions

1. **Bloom the coconut cream**: On low-medium heat, simmer 3/4 cup coconut milk for 5-10 minutes until it thickens and you can see oil separating on the edges.

2. **Add curry paste**: Add in the curry paste and saut√© until oil starts separating. If using chicken thighs, add them now and cook for 5-8 minutes before the next step.

3. **Build the curry base**: Add in remaining coconut milk, stock, Worcestershire sauce, and brown sugar. Simmer for 10 minutes.

4. **Add protein and vegetables**: Add in chicken breast or other lean protein and your vegetables. Cook for 5-8 minutes until done and adjust salt to your taste.

5. **Finish and serve**: Add in cilantro leaves and/or Thai basil just before turning the heat off. Serve with rice.

## Tips

- **Protein options**: Chicken thighs give the best flavor, but chicken breast, shrimp, tofu, or beef all work well
- **Vegetable variations**: Traditional vegetables include Thai eggplant, bamboo shoots, and green beans, but feel free to use what you have
- **Spice level**: Adjust the amount of curry paste to your heat preference
- **Storage**: Keeps well in the fridge for 3-4 days and flavors actually improve overnight
