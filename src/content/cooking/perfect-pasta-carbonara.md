# Perfect Pasta Carbonara

Carbonara is one of those dishes that seems simple but requires technique. No cream, no peas, no chicken - just eggs, cheese, guanciale, and pepper creating magic with hot pasta.

## The Secret to Perfect Carbonara

The key is temperature control. Too hot and you'll scramble the eggs; too cool and the sauce won't come together. It's all about the pasta water and timing.

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Guanciale
- Cut guanciale into small cubes (about 1cm)
- Cook in a large pan over medium heat until crispy (8-10 minutes)
- Reserve the rendered fat - it's liquid gold!

### 2. Make the Egg Mixture
- Whisk together egg yolks, whole egg, and both cheeses
- Add plenty of freshly ground black pepper
- The mixture should be thick and creamy

### 3. Cook the Pasta
- Boil pasta in well-salted water until al dente
- Reserve 1 cup of starchy pasta water before draining
- This water is crucial for creating the silky sauce

### 4. The Magic Moment
- Add hot, drained pasta to the pan with guanciale
- Remove from heat (important!)
- Quickly toss with egg mixture, adding pasta water gradually
- Keep tossing until you get a glossy, creamy sauce

## Pro Tips

- **Use the right pasta**: Spaghetti, tonnarelli, or rigatoni work best
- **Cheese matters**: Authentic Pecorino Romano is worth seeking out
- **No substitutions**: Guanciale > pancetta > bacon (in that order)
- **Timing is everything**: Have everything ready before you start combining

## Serving

Serve immediately in warmed bowls with extra cheese and black pepper. Carbonara waits for no one!
